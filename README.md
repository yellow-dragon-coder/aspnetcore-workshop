# ASP.NET Core 3.0 Workshop

Documentation and samples for ASP.NET Core 3.0 workshop.

**NOTE: This is a work in progress, using a preview version of .NET Core 3.0! Some planned features are not implemented because of bugs in EF Core 3.0 Preview and missing third-party library support for .NET Core 3.0**

**NOTE: Updated to .NET Core 3.0 Preview 8**

This workshop is intended as a walk-through into .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 3.0 features, creating a new Web API, preparing it for production use and consuming it from client-side Blazor client.

The workshop is partially based on my talk [Building production-ready APIs with ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/miroslavpopovic/production-ready-apis-sample-3.0).

It's also inspired by [.NET Presentations](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/home) and [workshops](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/blazor-workshop) created by .NET Core and ASP.NET Core teams. Some content for presentations is borrowed from there, as well as the Power Point presentation templates. Just to be clear - it's not a fork of some existing ASP.NET Core workshop, but a new one, created from scratch. Sample code and instructions for all sessions below are created for this workshop specifically.

## Getting started
